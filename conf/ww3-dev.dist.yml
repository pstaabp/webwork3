# These settings are used for running unit_tests.  You should choose a database
# that is separate from any either production or other testing database.  The
# sqlite one is recommended.  If you choose another full-featured DB, select a
# database that is different than others.

# For the sqlite database
database_dsn: dbi:SQLite:./t/db/sample_db.sqlite
# For mysql or mariadb
# note: choose a database
#database_dsn: dbi:mysql:dbname=webwork3_test

# Database credentials for mysql or mariadb.
# These are ignored if the 'sqlite' database is used.
